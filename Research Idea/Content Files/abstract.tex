The use of more relevant metrics of software systems could improve
various software engineering tasks, but identifying relationships among
metrics is not simple and can be very time consuming. 
Recommender systems can help with this decision-making process; many applications
have utilized these systems to improve the performance of their applications.
To investigate the potential benefits of recommender systems in regression 
testing, we implemented an item-based collaborative filtering recommender
system that uses user interaction data and application change history 
information to develop a test case prioritization technique.
To evaluate our approach, we performed an empirical study using three 
applications with multiple versions by comparing four control techniques.
Our results indicate that our recommender system can help improve the 
effectiveness of test prioritization; the performance of our approach
was particularly  noteworthy when we were under a time constraint.
