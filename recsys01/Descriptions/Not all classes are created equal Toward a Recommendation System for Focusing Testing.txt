In this paper, authors used pagerank alg to show that which classes are more critical and then they mentioned that those critical classes should be test first.
For testing they have used ECGM which is a graph based method. 
They have been inspired by "who should fix this bug"!
Also they consider some other factor such as rate of structural change for each class. 
They used Tabo search for pagerank.
