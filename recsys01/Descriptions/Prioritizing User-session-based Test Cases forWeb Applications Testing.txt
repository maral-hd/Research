It is a user session web base testing approach.
They examined multiple method and compare the prioritization techniques. 
they prioritize test suites by test lengths, frequency of appearance of request sequences, and systematic coverage of parameter-values and their interactions.
applied techniques are: 

.Test length based on number of base requests (Req- LtoS, Req-StoL): 
order by the number of HTTP requests in a test case
• Frequency-based prioritization (MFAS, AAS): 
order such that test cases that cover most frequently accessed pages/sequence of pages are selected for execution
before test cases that exercise the less frequently accessed pages/sequences of pages.
• Unique coverage of parameter-values (1-way): 
order tests to cover all unique parameter-values as soon as possible
• 2-way parameter-value interaction coverage (2-way): 
order tests to cover all pairwise combinations of parameter-values between pages as soon as possible
• Test length based on number of parametervalues(PV-LtoS, PV-StoL):
order by number of parameter-values used in a test case
• Random: randomly permute the order of tests
