Control Flow Analysis and Coverage Driven Testing for Web Services


In this paper authors used a combined technique of pagerank algorithm for testing web services. 

in this paper they show,  the information from both message and control flows can be combined to enhance the test quality.

Google pagerank calculat es t he linkage based “coverage score” for each operation.

Instead, they adopt a graph-theoretic interpretation of entailment motivated by graph isomorphism.

One software testing strategy is to maximize code coverage with minimal set of test cases. 

For flow based coverage test , they have to rank operations such that an operation with a high rank score would imply more operations must be “visited ”
before reaching this operation. Those “visited ” operationsare thus “covered ” by this operation. Consequently, this operation would lead to high test coverage.
